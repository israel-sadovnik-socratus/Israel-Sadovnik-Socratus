Today we have Quantum Mechanic.
On the basis of Quantum Mechanic we have genius scientific
technology but wrong / abstract philosophy of Quantum Theory.
Why?
First. Quantum Mechanic has no Reference Frame.
Second. Quantum Mechanic has one Hero –
- it is Quantum of light / Photon / Electron. 
And Einstein wrote about quantum of light / photon :
" All these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me
no nearer to the answer to the question, 'What are light quanta? ' 
Nowadays every Tom, Dick and Harry thinks he knows it,
but he is mistaken."

And the simple quantum particle - electron has six ( 6 ) formulas:
+E=Mc^2 and -E=Mc^2 , E=h*f , e^2=ah*c, 
E=-me^4/2h*^2= -13,6eV and E= ∞.
Nobody knows "why?"
Nobody knows their correlation, how to unite them together.
=.
We have a wide field for speculations.

Mathematics / Physics / Quantum theory and God / Gods.
=.
Long time ago Plato wrote:
" Mathematics is the language in which the gods speak to people."
/ Plato /
It means that religion without mathematical / physical background
can be fiction. It means that all different gods / religions must have one
common mathematical / physical basis.
It means that Brahman, Zeus, YHWH , God, Allah, . . . Supreme Creator,
the Supreme Being . . . and so on . . . . must know physical laws and
formulas to create Existence. It means that Brahman, Zeus, YHWH , God,
as the ONE (!) cannot create Universe without physical laws and formulas.

Charles de Montesquieu wrote:
" Everybody creates his God according to his own image and spirit. 
If triangles made a God they would give him three sides."
/ Charles de Montesquieu . Persian Letters, 1721 /
But if physicists make a God, they would give Him concrete
mathematical / physical parameters.
#
Eddington wrote:
" The Reasons of a modern science give, maybe 
the opportunity to make the conclusion
that the religion became acceptable
for sensible scientific mind, since 1927."
/ Arthur Stanley . Eddington /.
It means that from 1927 the modern science ( quantum theory )
can explain "religion" by math / physical laws and formulas. 
It means that Quantum theory can explain not only the earthly
matters but the heavenly matters too and unite them together,

“ Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real. 
If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, 
you haven't understood it yet.” 
/ ― Niels Bohr /

P.S.
" The mathematics of QM is straightforward, but making the 
connection between the mathematics and an intuitive picture 
of the physical world is very hard" 
/ Claude N. Cohen-Tannoudji . Nobel Prize in Physics 1997 /
Why? Because: 
a) we don't know the reference frame of quantum theory
b) we don't know what quantum of light is.
The reference frame and quantum of light are the basis of 
quantum theory all the rest is secondary.
And if the basis is unclear then the philosophy of physics is vague.

God and Soul in Quantum Theory. / By Israel Socratus. /
=.
Can the conception of God and Soul have Physical Background?
My answer is: "Yes, God and Soul have physical background
and can be explained by physical formulas, equations and laws."
I will try to prove my position.
=.
Question: what is God?
The Religious answer:
God is something Absolute, Infinite, Eternal, Spiritual,
the Highest form of Consciousness, Who created everything
in the Universe.
The Physical answer ( in my opinion) is more concrete:
There is an Absolute, Infinite, Eternal Reference Frame and IT is
Vacuum in the condition of Absolute Zero: T=0K,
that take the functions of God and create everything in the Universe.
Zero Vacuum T=0K is a "solo fabric" of creation everything in the Universe.
Zero Vacuum T=0K is a Metaphysical / Spirit World.
How can I prove my opinion?
1. God does not create this Material World directly Himself.
2. To create Material World and everything in It, God uses Spiritual Particles.
3. The modern name of these Spiritual Particles is Quantum of Light.
Quantum of Light is most phenomenal particle in the World.
Quantum of Light is the structural essence of the Material World.
The essence of all material objects is Quantum of Light.
Through the behavior of Quantum of Light we can understand
what an Absolute God has the Highest form of Consciousness.
==========..
a)
In the Vacuum Quantum of Light has maximal speed : c=1
(from our earthly- gravity point of view).
No material particles can ever attain this velocity. It means that this
constant characteristic brings quantum of light to the world which
is different from Material World and this is Vacuum World of Spirits.
b)
Many kinds of so-called different particles (waves) are only different
manifestation / modifications of Quantum of Light.
How can I prove this opinion?
It seems that different particles create different waves:
EM-waves, Gamma-Radiation waves, Röntgen-Radiation waves,
Light-Waves, Ultraviolet -waves, Super/Ultra-High-TV-waves,
Short/Mid/Long wave- length Radio Emission waves . . . but . .
. . . but the energy of each of them is written by formula: E=h*f.
It means that the difference between all these particles / radiations
depends only on frequencies and the background of these modifications
is one and the same particle: Quantum of Light in different frequencies.
c)
Question:
Why the simple quantum particle electron has six ( 6 ) formulas:
+E=Mc^2 and -E=Mc^2 ,
E=h*f and e^2=ah*c,
E=-me^4/2h*^2= -13,6eV and E= ∞ ?
My answer:
Because an electron and quantum of light / photon and antielectron
are one and the same particle in different actions and conditions and
" The Law of conservation and transformation of energy/ mass "
unites them together.
d)
The Quantum of Light is not static / firm particle.
Quantum of Light is an elastic particle and can change its geometrical form.
e)
Through so-called "vacuum fluctuation / transformation" Quantum of Light
can materialize or dematerialize its body ( virtual particle can become real
and vice versa) using its own inner impulse h or h*=h/2pi.
(Newtonian physics explains movement as a result of outside influence,
Quantum physics explains movement as a result of own inner power / impulse
of particle and therefore Quantum physics is only a modern Aristotle's
metaphysics)
f)
1. The potential state of Quantum of Light in the Zero Vacuum is: E=Mc^2.
2. In the straight constant movement its speed is c=1 and its energy is: E=hc
Quantum of Light behaves like a "particle".
3. In the rotation around its axis Quantum of Light behaves like "wave"
with energy: E=h*f. In the Zero Vacuum nobody has influence on
behavior of Quantum of Light. Quantum of Light by himself decided
in which state He wants to be, it means that Quantum of Light has some
kind of consciousness. The consciousness of Quantum of Light can evolve.
Quantum of Light takes part in creation atom, cell, flower, . . . etc . . . and
in creation every living being. And Its evolution of consciousness is going
step by step (from atom, cell, flower . . . to a living being )
according to ancient
Vedas conception: ‘ from vague wish up to a clear thought ’
g)
Now . . . . . if . . . .
If Quantum of Light have some kind of consciousness which can evolve and
the Absolute Zero T=0K gave the birth to this conscious Spiritual
Particles . . . .
then . . . . then it means that the T=0K by Itself has an Absolute the Highest
form of Consciousness.
===================
P.S.
The tendency to understand "God" by physical laws, formulas,
equations using the Quantum Theory never will be ended.
