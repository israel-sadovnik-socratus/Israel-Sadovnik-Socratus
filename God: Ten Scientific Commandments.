God: Ten Scientific Commandments. 
==. 
God has given to Physicists everything necessary to understand 
Him and His Genesis by Physical Laws and Formulas. 
===. 
Scheme: 
Fundamental Theory of Existence: 
Ten Commandments 
1 The infinite vacuum T=0K. ( background energy space: E ). 
2 The particle: 
C/D = pi, R/N= k , E = Mc^2 = kc^2 , h = 0 , i^2= -1 
3 The spins: h =E/t , h =kb, h* = h/2pi 
4 The photon, the inertia 
5 The electron: e^2 = h*ca, E = h*f , electromagnetic field 
6 The gravitation, the star, the time and space 
7 The Proton 
8 
The Evolution of interaction between Electron and Proton 
a) electromagnetic 
b) nuclear 
c) biological 
9 
The Laws 
a) The Law of conservation and transformation energy/mass 
b) The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle / Law 
c) The Pauli Exclusion Principle/ Law 
10 
The test. 
Every theory must be tested logically ( theoretical ) and practically 
a) Theory : Dualism of Consciousness: (consciousness / unconsciousness) 
b) Practice : Parapsychology. Meditation.

The secret of God, Soul and Existence is hidden 
in ‘ Vacuum and Quantum of Light Theory ’.

I want to know how God created this world 
I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, 
in the spectrum of this or that element 
I want to know His thoughts; the rest are details

" If we were looking for something that we could conceive 
of as God within the universe of the new physics, this ground 
state, coherent quantum vacuum might be a good place to start." 
/ Book ‘The quantum self ’ page 208, by Danah Zohar. /

" The reasons of a modern science give, maybe, the opportunity 
to make the conclusion, that the religion became acceptable 
for sensible scientific mind, since 1927. " 
/ Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington /
