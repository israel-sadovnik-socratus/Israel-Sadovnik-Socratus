Thou shalt have no other gods before Mathematics and Physics
     / If your god is dead, try mine /
There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.

Charles de Montesquieu wrote:
" Everybody creates his God according to his own image and spirit.
If triangles made a God they would give him three sides."
/ Persian Letters,  1721 /
But if physicists make a God, they would give Him concrete
mathematical / physical parameters.

 Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington was sure:
" The reasons of a modern science give, maybe, the opportunity
to make the conclusion, that the religion became acceptable
for sensible scientific mind, since 1927. "

 Scheme:
====
  1- The infinite vacuum T=0K ( E= ∞ )
2 - The particle: C/D = pi, R/N= k , E = Mc^2 = kc^2 , h = 0 , i^2= -1
3 - The spins: h =E/t , h =kb, h* = h/2pi
4 - The photon: E=hc  ( the inertia )
5 - The electron: e^2 = h*ca, E = h*f , electromagnetic field
6 - The gravitation (k), the star (h*f>kTlogW) , the time and space
7 - The Proton
8 - The Evolution of interaction between Electron and Proton:
a) electromagnetic
b) nuclear
c) biological
9 - The Laws
a) The Law of conservation and transformation energy/mass
b) The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle / Law
c) The Pauli Exclusion Principle/ Law
10 - The test.
Every theory must be tested logically ( theoretical ) and practically
a) Theory : Dualism of Consciousness: (consciousness / unconsciousness)
b) Practice : Parapsychology. Meditation.

P.S.
The secret of God, Soul and Existence is hidden in the theory:
  ‘'Vacuum (T=0K) and Quantum of Light (h)''
#
I want to know how God created this world
I am not interested in this or that phenomenon,
in the spectrum of this or that element
I want to know His thoughts; the rest are details

" If we were looking for something that we could conceive
of as God within the universe of the new physics, this ground
state, coherent quantum vacuum might be a good place to start."
