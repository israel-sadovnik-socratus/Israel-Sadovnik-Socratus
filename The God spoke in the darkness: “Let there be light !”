The God spoke in the darkness: “Let there be light !” 
====
And the God said in the darkness: 
Let there be light: and there was light. 
So, we must examine three conceptions: God, darkness and light.
1
In the darkness it means in the spacetime of dark mass/ energy.
The spacetime of dark mass/ energy it means in the Vacuum.
The Vacuum is the Infinite/ Eternal Homogeneous Space 
of the lowest ( the background ) level of Energy: E= 0.
The Vacuum is the Infinite/ Eternal Homogeneous Space
of the lowest ( the background ) level of temperature: T= 0K.
2.
The God is hidden into the Infinite/ Eternal Homogeneous 
Energy Space and we don’t know that to say about Him/ Her/ It.
But we know, that according to Quantum Physics a virtual 
energetic particles can exist in this Infinite/ Eternal 
Homogeneous  Energy Space.
So, we can suppose that, maybe, from these virtual energetic
particles the God created light/ quantum of light.
3.
So, in the beginning God created the Light.
How did He do it?
The Bible explain us that the God created the light very easy. 
God simply said:  ‘Let there be light: and there was light.’
And for many years everybody adopted this convincing proof
without any doubt.
Only poor Einstein had doubts. He wrote sadly : 
‘' All these fifty years of conscious brooding have brought me
no nearer to the answer to the question, 'What are light quanta?' 
Nowadays every Tom, Dick and Harry thinks he knows it,
but he is mistaken. ''
But Tom, Dick and Harry laughed. 
‘What cannot the old Jew understand?’ they said bewilder.
‘ Isn’t clear that quantum of light is a simply wave-particle,
of course, simultaneously ?’
    . . . . .
And now one part of mankind ( Religious part ) believes that
God created the light in very easy way.
And the other part of mankind ( Scientific part ) believes that
the light is the quantum of light which simply has his own
wave-particle abilities, of course, simultaneously.

These two great Mystical beliefs govern on the planet Earth 
without understand each other. This is situation that we have now.
=====
P. S.
- if the speed of light is constant . . . .  . then light doesn't produces EM waves
- If the speed of light is various   . . .  then light behaves like a wave-photon
